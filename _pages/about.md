I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the school of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Professor Weichen Liu.
I received my Bachelorâ€™s and Master's degree from Shandong University, China in 2016 and 2019.

My research mainly focuses accelerating sparse matrix operations on FPGAs.
